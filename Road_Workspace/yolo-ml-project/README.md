# YOLO Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project implements the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for object detection. It provides a complete pipeline from dataset loading to model training and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- `src/data/`: Contains scripts for dataset management and preprocessing.
- `src/models/`: Contains the YOLO model implementation and utility functions.
- `src/config/`: Configuration files for model parameters and dataset paths.
- `src/train.py`: Entry point for training the YOLO model.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for validating the model's functionality.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required dependencies for the project.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd yolo-ml-project
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To train the YOLO model, run the following command:
```
python src/train.py
```

## Examples
Include examples of how to use the model and visualize results here.
